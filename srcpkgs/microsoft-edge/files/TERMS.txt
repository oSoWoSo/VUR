MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT EDGE

After installation, these terms are also viewable in Microsoft Edge at edge://terms.

IF YOU LIVE IN (OR ARE A BUSINESS WITH A PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE “BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” SECTION 2.14 BELOW. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.

This is a license agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates) that describes your rights, obligations, and the conditions upon which you may use the software and any updates (“Software”) (except to the extent updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft's rights relating to pre-updated Software ). You should review the entire agreement, including any linked terms, because all of the terms are important and together create this agreement that applies to you.

By accepting this agreement or downloading or using the Software, you agree to all of these terms and consent to the transmission of certain information during your use of the Software as per the privacy statement described in your Windows License Terms or in Section 2.7, below. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the Software or its features.

This agreement comprises two sections: Section 1 applies if you use the Software on any Windows platform; Section 2 applies if you use it on any non-Windows platform, including MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux.

1.     MICROSOFT EDGE FOR WINDOWS DEVICES
1.1.        Windows License Terms Apply . Your Microsoft Software License Terms, Windows Operating System (“Windows License Terms”) govern your use of this Software on any Windows platform and are part of this agreement. You can view the Windows License Terms by going to https://aka.ms/useterms or going to Settings - System - About within Windows.
1.1.1.        Updates . The Software periodically checks for updates, and downloads and installs them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources, and Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with those updates. By accepting this agreement or using the Software, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.
1.2.        Previews . You may choose to use preview, insider, beta, or other pre-release versions of the Software (“Previews”) that Microsoft may make available. You may use Previews only up to the Software's expiration date and so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Previews are experimental and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in your Windows License Terms, Previews are provided “AS IS,” and no warranty, implied or express (including the Limited Warranty), applies to these versions. By installing Previews on your device, you may void or impact your device warranty and may not be entitled to support from your device manufacturer or network operator, if applicable. Microsoft is not responsible for any damage thereby caused to you. Microsoft may not provide support services for Previews. If you provide Microsoft comments, suggestions or other feedback about the Preview (“submission”), you grant Microsoft and its partners rights to use the submission in any way and for any purpose.
1.2.1.        Data Collection for Previews . For Previews, privacy and feature settings may not work as intended, and the Previews may not work with other Windows privacy settings, including the diagnostic data settings for Windows 10 or Windows 11. Data collected from your use of the Previews, including diagnostic, technical, error reports, crash dumps and other related data from your devices running Previews, may be used, stored, processed and analyzed to keep Windows, this Software, and the Previews up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Microsoft products and services and may be used for any other purpose described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement. If you disable data collection through controls available in the Previews, we may continue to collect diagnostic information about the download, the installation and removal of the Previews and “basic” data as described in the Windows Diagnostics section of the Microsoft Privacy Statement at https://aka.ms/privacy.
1.3.        Other Services . The Software may include apps or features that provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services Agreement at https://aka.ms/msa. You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service's terms of use or the app's settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions. You may not use tokens the Software uses to call into a Microsoft Azure service separate from the Software.
2.     MICROSOFT EDGE FOR NON-WINDOWS DEVICES
2.1.        Installation and Use Rights . The Software is licensed, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the Software on your device, for use by one person at a time, running a non-Windows platform, including MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux, so long as you comply with the terms and restrictions contained in this agreement.
2.2.        Third-Party Software . The Software may include third-party programs that are licensed to you under this agreement, or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, for the third-party programs can be viewed at https://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices. Even if such programs are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.
2.3.        Previews . You may choose to use preview, insider, beta, or other pre-release versions of the Software (“Previews”) that Microsoft may make available. You may use Previews only up to the Software's expiration date and so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Previews are experimental and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. Previews are provided “AS IS,” and no warranty, implied or express, applies to these versions. By installing Previews on your device, you may void or impact your device warranty and may not be entitled to support from your device manufacturer or network operator, if applicable. Microsoft is not responsible for any damage thereby caused to you. Microsoft may not provide support services for Previews. If you provide Microsoft comments, suggestions or other feedback about the Preview (“submission”), you grant Microsoft and its partners rights to use the submission in any way and for any purpose.
2.3.1.        Data Collection for Previews . For Previews covered under Section 2.3, privacy and feature settings may not work as intended, and the Previews may not work with your operating system privacy settings. Data collected from your use of Previews, including diagnostic, technical, error reports, crash dumps and other related data from your devices running Previews may be used, stored, processed and analyzed to keep the Previews up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Microsoft products and services and may be used for any other purpose described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement. If you disable data collection through controls available in the Previews, we may continue to collect diagnostic information about the download, the installation and any removal of the Previews and “basic” data as described in the Windows Diagnostics section of the Microsoft Privacy Statement at https://aka.ms/privacy.
2.4.        Other Services . The Software may include features or apps that provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services Agreement at https://aka.ms/msa. You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service's terms of use or the app's settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions.
2.5.        Communications with You . Microsoft may use your contact information (i) to communicate with you about your use of the Software, and (ii) to provide you with additional information, about the Software and other Microsoft products or services. This contact may be by email, SMS, instant message, web chat, phone, in the user interface, or other means, and may include offers. You can always choose whether you wish to receive promotional email, SMS messages, telephone calls and postal mail from Microsoft.
2.6.        Feedback . If you provide Microsoft comments, suggestions or other feedback about the Software to Microsoft (“Submission”), you grant Microsoft and its partners rights to use the Submission in any way and for any purpose. You will not give Microsoft a Submission that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its Software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
2.7.         Privacy; Consent to Use of Data . Your privacy is important to us. Some of the Software features send or receive information when using those features. By accepting this agreement and using the Software you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement at https://aka.ms/privacy, and as may be described in the user interface associated with the Software features.
2.8.         Restrictions . Microsoft reserves all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement and no other rights are licensed to you. For the avoidance of doubt, this license does not give you any right to, and you may not (and you may not permit any other person or entity to):
(a)    use or virtualize features of the Software separately;
(b)    publish, copy (other than make a single backup copy), rent, lease, or lend the Software;
(c)    work around any technical limitations in the Software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;
(d)    reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, or attempt to do so, except and only to the extent that the foregoing restriction is (i) permitted by applicable law; (ii) permitted by licensing terms governing the use of open-source components that may be included with the Software; or (iii) required to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License that are included with and linked to by the Software.
(e)    when using Internet-based features you may not use those features in any way that could interfere with anyone else's use of them, or to try to gain access to or use any service, data, account, or network, in an unauthorized manner;
(f)     use tokens the Software uses to call into a Microsoft Azure service separate from the Software.
2.9.         Documentation . If documentation is provided with the Software, you may copy and use the documentation for personal reference purposes.
2.10.      H.264/AVC and MPEG-4 Visual Standards and VC-1 Video Standards . The Software may include H.264/AVC, MPEG-4 Visual, and/or VC-1 codec technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C. requires this notice:
THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC, THE VC-1, AND THE MPEG-4 PART 2 VISUAL PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE STANDARDS (“VIDEO STANDARDS”) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC, VC-1, AND MPEG-4 PART 2 VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE https://aka.ms/mpegla.
2.11.      Export Restrictions . You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the Software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.
2.12.      Support Services . Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the Software. Any support provided is “as is,” “with all faults,” and without warranty of any kind.
2.13.      Updates . The Software periodically checks for updates, and downloads and installs them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources, and Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. By accepting this agreement or using the Software, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.
2.14.      Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver . We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it informally. If we can't, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator's decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, requests for public injunctions, and any other proceeding or request for relief where someone acts in a representative capacity aren't allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. “We,” “our,” and “us” includes Microsoft and Microsoft's affiliates.
(a)         Disputes covered—everything except IP . The term “dispute” is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Software, its price, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or this agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors', our, or our licensors' intellectual property rights.
(b)         Send a Notice of Dispute before arbitration . If you have a dispute that our customer service representatives can't resolve and you wish to pursue arbitration, you must first send an individualized Notice of Dispute to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or submit the form electronically. The Notice of Dispute form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499. Complete that form in full, with all the information it requires. We'll do the same if we have a dispute with you. This Notice of Dispute is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly submitted individualized Notice of Dispute through the first date on which an arbitration may properly be filed under this Section 2.14.
(c)         Small claims court option . Instead of sending a Notice of Dispute, either you or we may sue the other party in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action meets the small claims court's requirements and remains an individual action seeking individualized relief. The small claims court must be in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business).
(d)         Arbitration procedure . The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Software for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is less than $75,000 USD whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Software, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). The AAA's Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by this Section 2.14, will apply in Related Cases (discussed below). For more information, see https://aka.ms/adr. This agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with any applicable AAA rules. To initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us. The form must contain information that is specific to you and your claim. In a dispute involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business). The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim, but not relief that would affect non-parties.
The arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority: (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation, existence, scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to decide whether the parties have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements (including the individualized Notice of Dispute and Demand for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the prohibition on class, representative, private attorney-general, or combined actions or proceedings, or public injunctive relief; and (iv) to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this agreement.

If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be “Related Cases.” You and we agree that the AAA's Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules in effect when the Demand for Arbitration is filed, as modified by this Section 2.14, will apply to Related Cases. Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations will be resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch, each side may select up to 25 of these Related Cases to be filed and resolved in individual arbitrations under this Section 2.14; (ii) none of the other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved; and (iii) if, after that first batch, the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 25 of the Related Cases to be resolved in individual arbitrations under this Section 2.14. This process of batched individual arbitrations will continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases informally or through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive authority to enforce this paragraph, including whether it applies to a given set of claims, and to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with this paragraph.

(e)         Arbitration fees and payments . The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses.
In addition, if the dispute is not part of the Related Cases described above, the dispute involves less than $75,000, and before initiating arbitration you complied with all pre-arbitration requirements in this Section 2.14, then (1) we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses; and (2) if, at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator awards you more than our last written offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, we will pay you (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 USD (whichever is more); and (ii) for any reasonable attorney's fees you incurred; and any reasonable expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney accrued in connection with your individual arbitration.

(f)         Severability . If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this Section 2.14 unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which case the arbitrator issues an award on liability and individual relief before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of Section 2.14 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins).
2.15.      Entire Agreement . This agreement (together with the printed paper license terms or other terms accompanying any Software supplements, updates, and services that we provided, and that you use), and the terms contained in web links listed in this agreement, are the entire agreement for the Software and any such supplements, updates, and services (unless we provide other terms with such supplements, updates, or services).
2.16.      Applicable Law and Place to Resolve Disputes . If you acquired the Software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you acquired the Software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes that are not heard in arbitration or small claims court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes that are not heard in arbitration or small claims court.
2.17.      Consumer Rights; Regional Variations . This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the Software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the Software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
(a)         Australia . For consumers living in Australia, our services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. For major failures with the service, you are entitled:
(i)         to cancel your service contract with us; and
(ii)         to a refund for the unused portion, or to compensation for its reduced value.
You are also entitled to be compensated for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. If the failure does not amount to a major failure you are entitled to have problems with the service rectified in a reasonable time and, if this is not done, to cancel your contract and obtain a refund for the unused portion of the contract.

(b)         Germany and Austria . For consumers living in Australia, our services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. For major failures with the service, you are entitled:
(i)         No Contractual Guarantee . Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed Software.
(ii)         Limitation of Liability . In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

2.18.      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY . THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS THAT THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
2.19.      LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES . IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT'S AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE OR $5.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO ANYTHING OR ANY CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE.
It also applies even if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.
